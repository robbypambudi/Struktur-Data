Farewell to you and the youth I have
spent with you.
it was but yesterday we met in a dream.
You have sung to me in my aloneness,
and I of your longings have built a tower 
in the sky.
But now our sleep has fled and our dream
is over, and it is no longer dawn.
The noontide is upon us and our half
waking has turned to fuller day, and we 
must part.
If in the twilight of memory we should
meet once more, we shall speak again together
and you shall sing to me a deeper song.
And if our hands should meet in another
dream we shall build another tower in the 
sky.
